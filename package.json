Please upgrade to Unity 2021.3 or later.\n- Android - Support for the Unity Distribution Portal via the In-App Purchasing package. You may still use the Unity Distribution Portal in older versions of In-App Purchasing, or by writing your own implementation of the Unity Distribution Portal SDK directly, or as a custom store.\n- Support for Legacy Analytics (com.unity.modules.unityanalytics). Please use Unity Game Services Analytics instead (com.unity.services.analytics)."
