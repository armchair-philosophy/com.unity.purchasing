It can be set using `SetAppAccountToken(Guid token)` on the StoreExtendedService (e.g., `IAppleStoreExtendedService.SetAppAccountToken`), and it is also exposed in the IAppleOrderInfo interface for better integration with order details. For more details, see [AppAccountToken documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/transaction/appaccounttoken).\n- Apple - Updated PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy to reflect that IAP no longer uses required reason API.\n\n### Changed\n- Apple - CrossPlatformValidator is no longer used for receipt validation for Apple since StoreKit2 does it.\n- Apple - Receipt obfuscation for Apple has been removed.\n- Apple - `Product.appleProductIsRestored` is now obsolete since it's no longer used with StoreKit2.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed Non-Consumables being treated as Consumables (introduced by Unity IAP 5.0.0-pre.1)"
